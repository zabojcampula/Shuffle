# Shuffle

It is a 15-puzzle solver. The "Shuffle" program solves the [15-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). It allows randomize the playing field and then order it.

The algorithm  used for puzzle solving is not optimal. The only purpose was to write it as quickly as possible because I  made a bet with my colleaugues who can first implement working algorithm to solve the 15-puzzle. So here is the winner.
